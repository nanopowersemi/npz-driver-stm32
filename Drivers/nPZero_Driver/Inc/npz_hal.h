/**
 * @file npz_hal.h
 * 
 * @brief Header file for npz Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
 *
 * This file contains the hardware-specific functions and configurations for
 * the I2C communication interface. Users are required to customize these
 * functions according to their target hardware and MCU setup.
 *
 * The functions in this file serve as an abstraction layer between the 
 * driver and the hardware-specific I2C implementation on the target system.
 * Users should modify these functions to match the I2C peripheral and
 * communication protocol used in their system.
 *
 * @note This file provides placeholder functions and configurations that need
 * to be adapted to the specific hardware and MCU setup. The user is expected to modify
 * the function declaration in the npz_hal.c to fit their setup.
 *
 * @warning Incorrect configuration or improper implementation of these functions
 * may result in I2C communication failures or unexpected behavior.
